Setup
=====

- make a directory where this kit will be reside(e.g. /var/kits)
- edit firefox-kit.REPOS.CONF to replace /var/kits with your directory
  from a previous action
- cd YOUR_DIR && git clone https://github.com/lego12239/firefox-kit.git
- cp firefox-kit.REPOS.CONF /etc/portage/repos.conf/firefox-kit

Update

Notes
=====
- I had not working mouse wheel scrolling; to fix this i place in my browser start script "export MOZ_USE_XINPUT2=0" before firefox start line;
- I had not working http basic auth until i disabled "Browsec VPN - Free VPN for Firefox" addon.
